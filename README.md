# Morse

A mobile app that translates a text into morse code and flashes the code using the phone's camera flash. It can also send a morse code message to another device and receive and translate a message sent from the app in real time.

## Usage

First download an Android emulator(you can do so through Android studio)

```console
# see what emulators are available on your machine
flutter emulators
# launch the emulator
flutter emulators --launch <emulator_name>
# install/run the app on the emulator
flutter run
```
